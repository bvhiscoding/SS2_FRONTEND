# Blockchain-Based Voting System: A Secure and Transparent Electoral Solution
## Overview
Blockchain-Based Voting System is a secure and transparent digital platform designed to revolutionize the electoral process by leveraging blockchain technology. The application addresses the limitations of traditional paper-based voting systems (resource waste, logistical challenges, security concerns) and improves upon conventional e-voting systems by implementing an immutable, decentralized ledger that ensures vote integrity and prevents manipulation. Built with Angular JS for the frontend and ASP.NET Core for the backend, the system operates on the Polygon network to provide high throughput and cost-effective transactions while maintaining environmental efficiency.

The platform features comprehensive user authentication with multi-factor verification, secure voter registration, blockchain-based ballot creation, anonymous yet verifiable vote casting, real-time vote tracking, transparent counting mechanisms, and an intuitive analytics dashboard. By combining cryptographic security with blockchain's inherent transparency, our solution aims to increase electoral trust, reduce administrative costs, and enhance accessibility while maintaining the highest standards of vote privacy and system integrity. The system enables organizations to conduct secure elections where results can be independently verified without compromising voter anonymity, ultimately strengthening democratic processes through technological innovation.

## Technology Explanation

For Front-end design, this project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7.

## Functions

## UI UX Design

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
